# Kube AppStack

**Developing and orchestrating cloud-native applications using a personalized application stack, supported by tailored frameworks and libraries.**
<p>This project set introduces a custom DevOps automation tool powered by a Kubernetes Controller Manager. This solution centralizes resource governance by implementing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), webhooks, and Go microservices. It provides a unified platform for multi-cloud infrastructure control, incorporating addons(for DB, message queue,object storage), built-in CI/CD, monitoring, logging, security scanning.</p>
